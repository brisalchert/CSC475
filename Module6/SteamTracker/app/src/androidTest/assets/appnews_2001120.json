In \"A Way Out\" it was ‚ÄúTrust‚Äù and in \"It Takes Two\" it was ‚ÄúCollaboration‚Äù.\n\nWith Split Fiction, it‚Äôs all about ‚ÄúFriendship‚Äù.\n\nThat is also the heart of the experience we hope you will have as you play the game. Whether it is strengthening your bond with a partner or immersing yourself in the journey with an old friend.\n\nWe created Split Fiction by putting passion, creativity and a big love of video games first. This is a game that was built collaboratively by everyone at Hazelight and we haven‚Äôt shied away from putting not only our best but also wildest ideas into it.\n\nWe hope you will enjoy playing our game as much as we did making it. We are so eager to let you and other players around the world finally dive into our latest co-op adventure. To say that we‚Äôre proud of it is an understatement!\n\nWe also hope you will make those lasting memories in Split Fiction that only come from sharing an experience with someone else - that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about in the end.\n\nEnjoy,\nHazelight Studios\n\n[previewyoutube=es6YsZUxLpE;full][/previewyoutube]\n\n[u][b]Welcome to Split Fiction[/b][/u]\n\nGrab your co-op buddy and get ready to go on an out-of-this-world sci-fi and fantasy adventure in Hazelight Studios‚Äô latest game, Split Fiction ‚Äì available now on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and Verified on Steam Deck.\n\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/6cd78d501c58ab08ec771ec54fefb68ed53eb4e0.png[/img]\n\nExperience mind-blowing moments as you‚Äôre pulled into the many worlds of Split Fiction, a boundary-pushing, action-packed cooperative journey from the studio behind 2021 Game of the Year winner, It Takes Two.

You will be able to easily send game invites and join your friends on Steam directly through the Steam Friends List system, allowing you to get into the chaotic action quicker. Please note, however, that you‚Äôll need a free EA account if you want to connect with a friend who‚Äôs playing on a different platform through crossplay, such as Xbox or PlayStation consoles.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/802e1a1c6b9ee8bbaf1121887ed4646c8f41708f.png[/img]\n\n\n[previewyoutube=FWkdIOfZIeU;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nWhether you‚Äôre at home or on the go, you will be able to transport yourself into the world of Mio and Zoe‚Äôs mind-boggling adventure as Split Fiction is Verified on Valve‚Äôs Steam Deck handheld device, giving you even more options to take advantage of Split Fiction supporting crossplay. You will also be able to take advantage of the Steam Cloud Save functionality, meaning you can play on your PC, save and close the game, then carry on where you left off on your Steam Deck and vice versa! We‚Äôre excited to see all the unexpected locations the community will end up playing Split Fiction at launch and beyond. \n\n[h2]PC Specs[/h2]\nFor those of you who will be stepping into Mio and Zoe‚Äôs shoes on PC, the below chart lists the Minimum and Recommended Specifications the game will require, giving you an idea of what will be needed from your PC to experience Split Fiction‚Äôs immense variety of environments and gameplay challenges in their true glory.

In A Way Out, you take control of Leo Caruso and Vincent Moretti, an unlikely duo who team up to escape from prison. Meanwhile in It Takes Two, you play as married couple May and Cody Goodwin, trying to save them from a seemingly inevitable divorce.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/f437ca5a30cb1a67a6c30c31e45f4954a489ae32.jpg[/img]\n\n\nHazelight Studios are keeping that trend up as they introduce two brand new player characters in Split Fiction. You will take control of two unpublished authors, Mio and Zoe, who you will quickly find are [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2001120/view/506192738774942884?l=english]worlds apart[/url]! When you first meet Mio and Zoe, they have been lured into Rader Publishing Headquarters with the promise of a potential publishing deal which goes horribly wrong, trapping them inside a simulation of their stories which you have to help them escape. In this blog, we're going to dive deeper into their characters so that you can confidently pick your favourite when you get your hands on the game! \n\n[u][b]Mio Hudson - Science Fiction Author[/b][/u]\nReserved. Decisive. Realist. Introvert.\n\nRaised in the city with her father, Mio has barely scraped by for the last couple of years. She isn't looking for fame or recognition as an author, she's just in it for the money. Her love for all things sci-fi is reflected in her literary works, taking place in neon lit cyberpunk cities, harsh futuristic weapon plants and even in the coldness of outer space.\n\nExpect to see her love for sci-fi shine through in the abilities she gains inside the simulations, where she may become a gravity defying ninja equipped with a lethally sharp energy sword, wear an advanced exosuit that grants remote control of drones, or dual-wield laser blasters in futuristic combat armour.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/7e304a39ac4d4175ad846918660fee89f183630f.jpg[/img]\n\n[u][b]Zoe Foster - Fantasy Author[/b][/u]\nCharismatic. Empathetic. Optimist. Extrovert.\n\nA cheerful country girl with a deep need to prove to her family that she's not a complete failure. Zoe hopes that a publishing deal will solve all of her problems. Fantasy is her favoured genre, with her portfolio containing works of fiction about escaping towns overrun by trolls, battling through forests against an impending ice age, and protecting the last dragons from extinction.\n\nGiven her love for the fantastical, you can look forward to seeing Zoe as a magical shapeshifter flying across the lands as a fairy, wield a mythical sword whilst riding a dragon into a battle of the ages, or soar between floating islands with a magical kite.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/20983f245e5dd712d6dcd036d2a613798cfe3e47.jpg[/img]\n\n\nAs our characters are clearly such polar opposite personalities, they will have to come to terms with their differences, uncover hidden secrets about themselves, and realise that in order to escape the simulations they find themselves trapped in, they will have to work together and overcome the odds through the power of friendship.\n\nDuring the game announcement at The Game Awards in December, Josef Fares revealed that the characters' names mean a great deal to him, as Mio and Zoe are in fact named after his daughters! \n\nNow for the tricky question for you and your co-op partner: who is going to play as Mio and who will play as Zoe√¢‚Ç¨¬¶?\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/65fd8f7b5bf11e869d2a5dda2585c235ab59b400.jpg[/img]\n\n[b][u][h3]The Friends Pass[/h3][/u][/b]\n\n\nLike A Way Out and It Takes Two, Hazelight Studios' staple feature, The Friend's Pass*, returns again, allowing one player that owns the game to invite a friend to play online for FREE!

An accident puts Mio and Zoe inside the same shared simulation, throwing them back and forth between their own sci-fi and fantasy fiction while the nefarious publishing company tries to steal all of their ideas.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/a47c9d760b73dd3fe25bd82bf52ee32272b04c6e.jpg[/img]\n\n[h3]What Are Side Stories?[/h3]\n\nIf you‚Äôve played A Way Out or It Takes Two before, you‚Äôll know that Hazelight Studios are masters of co-op gameplay variety. In addition to all of the incredible sci-fi and fantasy variety featured in the Split Fiction main story, you will encounter mysterious, out of place portals that you can enter to explore all new and vastly different worlds and locations that are completely optional.\n\nThese are Side Stories! Side Stories are anomalies that occur as a consequence of Mio and Zoe being stuck in the same simulation. These portals are attempts by the simulation to steal unfinished stories and ideas that Mio and Zoe wrote when they were younger, leading to some truly weird, wonderful, and chaotic situations.\n\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/bd11b9c831da0216566c26176deddafa91e38df1.jpg[/img]\n\nWithout wanting to spoil them all, you can look forward to experiencing Side Stories featuring a daring mountain climb filled with Giants, riding Sandfish across a desert and snowboarding while performing killer tricks down a mountain - under heavy fire. Other Side Stories will have you become pigs and finding out exactly how sausages are made, chasing enemies while water-skiing and exploring the depths of space on a spacewalk gone wrong ‚Äì these are just a few examples of Mio and Zoe‚Äôs imagined Side Story scenarios, which they now have to live out (and escape from) all the while adding even more crazy and chaotic gameplay variety on your adventure through Split Fiction.\n\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/7c21ed9994b70749d349f61e47c88bf7d33c5a12.jpg[/img]\n\nAs these stories have been deeply influenced by our authors' pasts, they will experience long since forgotten ideas and secrets about themselves. Once a Side Story has been completed, our characters return back through the portal to the main level where they first entered the encounter, filled with even greater determination to escape from Rader‚Äôs machine with their memories and stories intact‚Ä¶ so, going back to our original question, are you up to the challenge?\n\nFun Fact - Hazelight Studios host internal Game Jams in their studio alongside regular game development where they all work together to come up with all kinds of crazy new gameplay mechanics and unexpected story moments. Hazelight then takes the best ideas and creations and adds them into their games ready to give you never before seen co-op experiences and mind blowing moments. This is how Side Stories are brought to life for you to experience at launch!\n\n\n[h3]The Friends Pass[/h3]\n\nLike A Way Out and It Takes Two, Hazelight Studios‚Äô staple feature, The Friend‚Äôs Pass*, returns again, allowing one player that owns the game to invite a friend to play online for FREE!
